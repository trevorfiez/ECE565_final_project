\section{Conclusion}


We derived the FIM and CRLB for estimating the parameters of a mixture model of two binomial distributions with $M=2$ different categories. 
Our derivations can easily be extended to multimodal distributions with any number of categories.
We showed the Maximum Likelihood equations for our problem.
Because the equations do not have a closed-form solution, we used the EM algorithm to obtain an esimator. We derived the equations needed to perform the E-step and M-step.
We also showed how to use a MOM estimator, where we simply use the first, second, and third order moments to generate a system of equations. By solving this system, we obtain the estimates for our parameters.
We showed in the empirical results that CRLB is a very low bound, as EM and MOM do not get close to it.
EM and MOM estimators have a similar performance, with differences only in the edge cases.
We also showed the impact of initialization on the EM algorithm.
